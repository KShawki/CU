Hardwired Control Unit:
======================
Is used to implement (Design) the Control Unit through 2 Methods either Sequence Counter or Finite State Machine.

Operation(Macro-operation) is composed of a sequence of Micro-operations.
Any Macro-operation (as Addition) to be achieved ---> Smaller operations are executed first called Micro-operations (AR <-- PC).

In Addition, we make 6 Micro-operations.
We can make 2 Micro-operations in the same clock cycle.

In case of "Direct Memory Addressing", we can let T4 = 1 instead of T3 = 1 (Nothing) to avoid one useless step.
Finite State Machine ---> It means the machine has to transition from one state to another in to perform different actions (instead of sequence counter to avoid above problem).

How Finite State Machine solve the useless T3 in case of "Direct Memory Addressing" in Memory Reference Instruction?
	---> if you came to direct addressing case, change the state to be T4 = 1 instead of T3

MicroprogrammedCU:
====================
Is used to implement (Design) the Control Unit.

EA ---> Effective Address

We will make a read-only Memory named Control Memory.
We will add in it bunch of Micro-instructions.
Macro-instruction is composed of sequence Micro-instructions.
Each Micro-instruction ---> composed of 1 or > Micro-operations
		   ---> executed at 1 clock cycle

ORG 0 ---> 0 is the memory location where the next instruction will begin from.

Hardwire is faster but more complex and expensive.
