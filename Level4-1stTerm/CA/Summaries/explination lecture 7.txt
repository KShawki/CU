Basic Control Unit:
------------------------
Control unit is responsible for execution of any instruction.
Control unit consists of combinational logic gates.
To execute instruction, we need >1 clock pulse.
Steps of execution (Instruction Cycle):
		1- Fetch instruction from memory.
		2- Decode Instruction.
		3- Execute.

Deocoder output = 2^ number of input
1 of the outputs of decoder = 1 & the rest of outputs = 0   (depend on operation from (12/13/14))

If upper decoder input = 001 -> d1=1 and remining d =0 so i know 001 is + operation so we are adding.
	---> the benifet from this that we check only 1 wire (d1) to know if we are adding instead of checking 3 wires (14 13 12).
	---> all this info came after we fecth instruction from memory and put it in the instruction register.

Control unit connect its output to the inputs of register, memory and bus.

Sequence counter has incrementer to increment output by 1 when clock pulse.
Sequence counter is binary counter.

Sequence counter has Synchronous clear, when it = 1 and clock pulse ---> the output will be = 0.
In the lower decoder when output = 0000 ->t0=1 and the remining all t = 0 (in each cycle, the output increases by 1).
The lower decoder determines in which cycle we are for the instruction.

InstructionFetch:
---------------------
*first we need to get instruction address which found in pc and put it in AR how???
1- when t0 =1 so we make bus adjust with source and we take address from pc so bus = 010 = 2
2- connect t0 with load of AR
when the clock cycle finished the address moves from PC to AR.

*second step when t1 = 1 take instruction from memory unit and put address in IR how????
1- read of memory = 1
2- selection of bus = 111 = 7 (so that t1 connected to s0 and s1 and s2)
3- load of IR =1

The previous 2 steps called fetch phase 
Fetch Stage: The next instruction is fetched from the memory address that is currently stored in the program counter and stored into the instruction register, (from google)
At the end of the fetch operation, the PC points to the next instruction that will be read at the next cycle.(from google)

when we increases the PC by 1 ---> we make it point to the next instruction and carry its address. 
PC increases by 1 why??? 
----> to reduce number of cycle.

PC is binray counter and register.

Instruction Cycle:
----------------------
T0,1,2 are same for all instructions.
